    staff.

- q: Can middle school students attend?
  a:
    Yes, middle school students can attend. If your student doesn't have much experience with coding, we ask that you
    pick them up around 6pm, as the overnight portion is usually too much for young beginners.

- q: Can elementary school students attend?
  a:
    CodeDay is not a good environment for very young students; we recommend participants be at least 12 years old.
