- q: Do I need to come with a team?
  a:
    No! In fact, most people don't come with a team! At the beginning of every event, everyone will pitch ideas for
    what they want to build. You can form a team then.

# What to Bring
#####

- q: What do I need to bring?
  a:
    Bring your laptop and mouse. Food will be provided. If you're planning on sleeping, bring a sleeping bag, pillow,
    and toothbrush. Desktop PCs and monitors are also allowed, although less common.

- q: Can I bring my desktop?
  a:
    Absolutely, but make sure it has a wifi card; we're usually not allowed to use the ethernet ports at venues. You'll
    also need to bring your own monitor, mouse, keyboard, and cables.

- q: Can I attend with only a tablet or phone?
  a:
    If you're new to programming, you can definitely get by with only a tablet (although a laptop is better). We
    recommend that you don't try to use a phone as your primary device at CodeDay because of the small screen.

- q: What if I don't have a laptop?
  a:
    We sometimes have computers available. If so, this will be listed on the registration page, and you'll have the
    opportunity to request one after you register in the process of signing the waiver. You can also use a tablet.
