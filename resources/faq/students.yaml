# Teams
#####

- q: Do I need to come with a team?
  a: |
    No! In fact, most people don't come with a team! At the beginning of every event, everyone will pitch ideas for
    what they want to build. You can form a team then.

- q: How big can a team be?
  a: |
    If you want to win one of the main awards (Best in Show and Best in Class), you can't have more than 6 people
    on your team. Otherwise, you can still participate, but you'll only be eligible for special awards.

- q: Can I work on an existing project?
  a: |
    You can work on existing projects, but please let the judges know what you did ahead of time. Depending on what you
    did ahead of time, you might not be eligible for the main awards (Best in Show and Best in Class), but you
    will be eligible for special awards.

- q: What if I already have a team?
  a: |
    You can have a pre-formed team, but you still need to pitch your idea and be open to new people joining.

#####
# Experience/Age
#####

- q: What's the maximum age?
  a: |
    You may attend CodeDay if you are in school and between the ages of 12-25.

- q: I'm an older student and want to attend! Why don't you allow students over 25?
  a: |
    CodeDay is an event mostly attended by high school students, and we aren't able to allow older attendees, both for
    liability reasons, and because it isn't really the right atmosphere for adults.

- q: I don't know how to code, can I still attend?
  a: |
    You don't need to have any experience to attend CodeDay! Whether you're interested in learning, or just want to
    make art or music, there will be plenty for you to do!

- q: I'm an experienced programmer, should I attend?
  a: |
    CodeDay is a great place for experienced programmers to try something new, and meet new friends.

- q: Can I attend if I dropped out of high school?
  a: |
    If you're not a current student, but still high-school-aged (18-and-under), you are welcome to attend.

#####
# Hackathon
#####
- q: Is CodeDay a hackathon?
  a: |
    CodeDay isn't really a traditional hackathon. By format, it's very similar, but we don't have a focus on prizes,
    swag, or getting internships.

- q: What are the prizes?
  a: |
    There are some small awards, but no real official prizes. CodeDay is more about having fun and trying something new
    than winning a prize.

- q: What companies will be there?
  a: |
    We don't usually have many companies there to recruit or distribute swag. CodeDay is more about having fun and
    trying something new than competing to impress companies and getting internships.

- q: What swag do you have?
  a: |
    We have some t-shirts and stickers, but not much else. CodeDay is more about having fun and trying something new
    than getting swag.

# Check-in/out
#####

- q: Can I leave early?
  a: |
    You may leave early if you're over 18. If you're under 18, you'll need to have a parent pick you up, or have them
    bring a signed note letting us know it's ok.

- q: Can I arrive late?
  a: |
    It's ok to arrive a little late, but we recommend you arrive no later than 3pm, unless you already have a team
    you're planning to work with.

- q: Do I need a parent to drop me off?
  a: |
    You do not need to be dropped off by a parent, as long as you've completed your waiver online ahead of time.

- q: Do I need a parent to pick me up?
  a: |
    You do not need a parent to pick you up if you leave at the end of the event. If you want to leave early, and
    are under 18, a parent will need to pick you up, or you'll need to bring a signed note.

- q: Can I leave and come back?
  a: |
    You can leave and come back, but if you're under 18 you'll need to be picked up by a parent, or bring a signed
    note letting us know it's ok. You may not be able to return until 9am for security reasons.

- q: Do I stay overnight? Do I sleep there?
  a: |
    Most students stay overnight, and sleep at CodeDay. You can leave and come back, however if you're under 18 you'll
    need to be picked up by a parent, or bring a signed note letting us know it's ok.

- q: Where will I sleep?
  a: |
    Most students sleep near their work area (we recommend bringing a sleeping bag, camping pad, and/or whatever else
    will make you comfortable). We try to provide dark, quiet rooms for students to sleep (separated by gender), but
    this isn't always possible.

#####
# What to Bring
#####

- q: What do I need to bring?
  a: |
    Bring your laptop and mouse. Food will be provided. If you're planning on sleeping, bring a sleeping bag, pillow,
    and toothbrush. Desktop PCs and monitors are also allowed, although less common.

- q: Can I bring my desktop?
  a: |
    Absolutely, but make sure it has a wifi card; we're usually not allowed to use the ethernet ports at venues. You'll
    also need to bring your own monitor, mouse, keyboard, and cables.

- q: Can I attend with only a tablet or phone?
  a: |
    If you're new to programming, you can definitely get by with only a tablet (although a laptop is better). We
    recommend that you don't try to use a phone as your primary device at CodeDay because of the small screen.

- q: What if I don't have a laptop?
  a: |
    We sometimes have computers available. If so, this will be listed on the registration page, and you'll have the
    opportunity to request one after you register in the process of signing the waiver. You can also use a tablet.

- q: Is there food? What food is there?
  a: |
    Your ticket includes food. If you have any specific dietary restrictions, please let us know in advance. You're
    also welcome to bring your own food or snacks.
