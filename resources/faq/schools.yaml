- q: How safe is CodeDay?

    We happily accept registrations from schools! Just contact us at schools@srnd.org for more information.

- q: Can we pay by PO?
  a:
    We accept payment by card, check, or PO from schools. Visit our school registration page or email schools@srnd.org
    for more information.

- q: Are staff background-checked?

    Our staff, volunteers, and mentors are all background-checked.

- q: What are the prerequisites to attend?
  a:
    Other than being a student, there really are no prerequisites! CodeDay is one of the most beginner-friendly events
    available.

- q: What will students learn?
  a:
    At the end of the event, students will be able to work with a team to create specifications for a project, search
    online for answers to technical problems, and program a complete and functioning application or game.

- q: Do we need chaperones? Can we bring them if we want?
  a:
    Chaperones or teachers are not required to attend, but are recommended for groups of more than 10 students. We will
    need to either conduct our own background check on attending chaperones, or you will need to confirm that your
    school has performed them.

- q: Do students need a waiver?
  a:
    We require students to complete a waiver. These will be emailed to the parent emails provided when you register.
